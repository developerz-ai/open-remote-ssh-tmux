// The workflow this exists for: you are developing against a remote server, you see a
// visual bug in a webapp on your LOCAL screen, and you want to hand that screenshot to a
// tool running on the REMOTE (Claude Code, in one of this fork's tmux terminals). The
// clipboard lives on your machine; the tool lives on the server; nothing bridges them.
// So: read the image locally, write it to the remote filesystem, and paste the path.
//
// Why this can't use the VS Code clipboard API: `vscode.env.clipboard` is text-only
// (`readText`/`writeText`, vscode.d.ts:10669) — there is no image read. Binary clipboard
// data exists only via `DataTransfer` for *editor* drop/paste providers, not terminals.
// The extension is `extensionKind: ["ui"]` though, so it runs as a Node process on the
// user's machine and can shell out to the platform's native clipboard tool. That is the
// only reason this is possible at all, and it is why these commands MUST run locally:
// run them on the remote and they read the server's (empty) clipboard.
//
// Deliberately independent of `src/tmux/*` — no imports either way. This is a clipboard
// concern, not a terminal-lifetime one, and keeping it separable means it can be lifted
// into its own extension without untangling anything.
//
// As with `tmuxSession.ts`, this module is the ONLY place these command lines are built,
// so quoting and path construction are auditable in one file.

 *   * plant `/tmp/open-remote-ssh-tmux-<uid>` as a symlink to a directory of the victim's.
 *     `mkdir -p` follows symlinks for intermediate components, so the images were written
