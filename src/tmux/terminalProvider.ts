// The VS Code-facing heart of the fork: a terminal-profile provider that backs
// each integrated terminal with a tmux session (`tmuxSession.ts` — the ONLY place
// tmux command lines are built; this module never concatenates a tmux string).
// Its whole job is deciding *which slot* a terminal maps to, so the two hard
// invariants hold:
//
//   * Invisible — profiles are plain `{shellPath:'tmux', shellArgs, cwd}`, the tab
//     is titled after the workspace folder (never "tmux"); no tmux UI (Route A, see
//     docs/idea/tmux-approach.md). The one settings write in the whole layer —
//     `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux`, Workspace-scoped, only when the user
//     has no default at any scope — lives in `extension.ts`'s
//     `reconcileDefaultTerminalProfile`, not here.
//   * No zombies / no stealing — a *new* terminal takes the lowest slot not open
//     in this window and not currently attached by another client on the remote,
//     so a second client (laptop while the PC is attached) lands on a fresh slot
//     instead of -A-attaching into the PC's session. On reload we re-attach this
//     client's own mapped survivors and *adopt* detached orphans (hand-off), but
//     never touch a session another client holds.
//
// Everything is dependency-inverted (D in SOLID): the remote command runner
// (`RemoteExec`), the persistence (`vscode.Memento`), the terminal opener, and the
// logger are all injected, so the allocation/restore/adoption logic is pure and
// unit-testable with no real ssh2.
//
// Terminal close has exactly two meanings, and they are decided by `TerminalExitReason`:
//
//   * the *window* went away (shutdown/reload) or the shell exited — detach only. The
//     session lives on in the tmux server; that is the whole close-PC/open-laptop use case.
//   * the *user* closed the terminal (reason User) — `kill-session`. Closing a terminal
//     means closing it, exactly as in stock open-remote-ssh, and anything less leaves a
//     session running on the remote that nothing will ever show again. An earlier version
//     "tombstoned" such slots instead (skipping them in restore *and* adoption while the
//     session kept running); that shipped as a permanent invisible zombie, reported from
//     the field as "1 lost". Session death is otherwise a process exiting
//     (`remain-on-exit off`, 02); empty leftovers are cleaned by the reaper
//     (`sessionReaper.ts`), not here.

 * How long the restore queue stays open for VS Code to claim from.
 *
 * These terminals are not `isTransient`, so VS Code persists them and restores split/group
 * layout — the thing an extension cannot reproduce, since there is no API to *read* a
 * terminal's split group. The catch, learned the hard way in the field: VS Code does not
 * replay the stored `shellArgs` when it revives an extension-profile terminal. It calls
 * {@link TerminalProfileProvider.provideTerminalProfile} again. A provider that answers
 * that with a freshly allocated slot mints a brand-new tmux session per revived terminal,
 * which is exactly what 1.0.8 shipped:
 *
 *   tmux terminals: 2 re-attached, ...     <- reconcile restored slots 0 and 3
 *   tmux terminal: new slot 1 (...)        <- VS Code's revive, 1.3s later
 *   tmux terminal: new slot 2 (...)        <- and again
 *
 * Four tabs, two of them empty new sessions, and the user closing three of them by hand.
 *
 * So restore does not create terminals up front. It builds a queue of sessions that want a
 * terminal and lets VS Code's revive *consume* it — each revive call gets the next session
 * to restore, so the layout comes from VS Code and the sessions come from here. Whatever is
 * still unclaimed once this window closes is opened directly, which covers a machine with
 * nothing to revive (hand-off) and a VS Code that revived fewer terminals than we have
 * sessions.
 *
 * This value is only the *floor* — the beat reconcile waits before reading the window at
 * all. Closing the queue on a fixed timer was itself the field bug of 1.0.9: see
 * {@link REVIVE_DEADLINE_MS}.

 * nothing we can see. Field report (v1.0.9, two split terminals, one reload):
 *
 *   28.670  tmux terminals: 0 to re-attach, 2 to reclaim, ...   <- queue final
 *   31.172  tmux terminals: opened 2 session(s) VS Code did not restore
 *   33.450  tmux terminal: new slot 2 (...)   <- the revive, 2.3s past the grace
 *   34.038  tmux terminal: new slot 3 (...)
 *
 * Four tabs where two belonged: the drain opened the two survivors as plain tabs, then the
 * revive found an empty queue and minted two new sessions — with the restored split layout
 * wrapped around the *wrong* pair. Not zombies (every tab held a live session), but exactly
 * the duplicate the queue exists to prevent. Raising 2500 would only move the goalposts.
 *
 * So the wait ends on *evidence* instead: every queued slot either claimed through
 * {@link TmuxTerminalProvider.provideTerminalProfile} or observed in the window (a reload
 * inside the reconnection grace reconnects the pty without asking for a profile). This
 * deadline is only reached when a revive is genuinely not coming — VS Code persistence off,

 * in a burst — 0.6s apart in the 1.0.9 log — and it may well revive *fewer* than we have
 * sessions, because it only persisted the terminals from its own last window. Waiting for
