# Open Remote - SSH (tmux)

A VS Code / VSCodium extension that connects to a remote dev machine over
SSH — **identical to [open-remote-ssh](https://github.com/jeanp413/open-remote-ssh)
in look and feel** — with one under-the-hood upgrade: **remote terminals are
backed by [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)**, so they persist and can be
re-attached from any machine.

![Open Remote SSH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeanp413/open-remote-ssh/master/docs/images/open-remote-ssh.gif)

## Why

You work across a PC, a laptop, and a VPS that's the actual dev environment.
Close the PC, open the laptop, and land back in the **same terminals** — same
scrollback, same running processes (a long `Claude Code` task, a build, a
migration) — regardless of which client connected last or whether the network
dropped in between.

With stock open-remote-ssh, a remote terminal's lifetime is coupled to the
client/session that opened it: closing the window, switching machines, or a
vscode-server restart can take a running task down with it. This fork moves
that lifetime into a **tmux server on the remote** — a process no client
owns — so terminals and the work inside them outlive any one connection.

**Scope is terminals only.** Editing, file changes, saving, extensions, and
port forwarding already reconnect fine (the vscode-server persists) — this
fork doesn't touch that path. It's invisible: no tmux commands, no tmux UI,
same connect flow as open-remote-ssh. See
[`docs/idea/why.md`](docs/idea/why.md) for the full motivation and
[`docs/idea/persistence-model.md`](docs/idea/persistence-model.md) for the
honest technical picture (below).

## Install

Releases ship as a `.vsix` on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/developerz-ai/open-remote-ssh-tmux/releases)
(not yet on Open VSX or the VS Code Marketplace).

1. Download `open-remote-ssh-tmux-<version>.vsix` from the latest release.
2. Optionally verify it against the published `.sha256`:
   `sha256sum -c open-remote-ssh-tmux-<version>.vsix.sha256`
3. In VS Code / VSCodium: Command Palette → `Extensions: Install from VSIX…`
   → pick the downloaded file.
4. VSCodium < 1.75 and VSCode-OSS also need the extension enabled in
   `argv.json` — see [Activation](#activation) below.
5. **Fully close and reopen the remote window.** This extension resolves the
   remote authority, so a newly installed build only takes effect on a fresh
   resolve — `Developer: Reload Window` alone is not always enough.

### Installing a locally built VSIX

```bash
npm run package          # produces open-remote-ssh-tmux-<version>.vsix
```

> **Bump the version before reinstalling.** Installing a `.vsix` whose version
> matches the already-installed one is frequently a silent no-op — you keep
> running the old code while believing you upgraded. Either bump `version` in
> `package.json`, or uninstall the extension first.

### Verifying it actually wired up

The extension is a **UI extension** (`extensionKind: ["ui"]`): it runs on your
*local* machine, not the remote. Do not expect to find it in the remote's
extension list. To confirm the tmux layer engaged, open
`Remote-SSH: Show Log` and look for:

```
Tmux terminal layer wired successfully
tmux terminals: 1 re-attached, 0 reclaimed, 0 adopted, 0 pruned
```

If instead you see `Tmux wiring failed: …`, the layer is off and terminals fall
back to plain shells — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Requirements

- **Remote host:** tmux **≥ 2.6** for tmux-backed persistent terminals on
  Unix-like remotes (Linux, macOS). Detected automatically on connect — if
  tmux is missing or too old, the extension logs why and falls back to plain
  (non-persistent) terminals; the base SSH connection is never blocked.
- **Windows remotes:** tmux is Unix-only. Windows remotes get stock,
  non-persistent terminals — same as upstream open-remote-ssh — and nothing
  else about the connection changes.
- Everything in upstream's [SSH Host Requirements](#ssh-host-requirements)
  and [Requirements](#activation) below still applies (this fork changes
  terminals only, not the SSH/server-install path).

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `remote.SSH.tmux.enabled` | `auto` | `auto` enables tmux-backed terminals on Unix-like remotes and disables on Windows; `on` requires tmux (fails if unavailable); `off` disables the feature entirely. |
| `remote.SSH.tmux.reapOnConnect` | `true` | Automatically clean up empty/dead tmux sessions when connecting to a remote. Keeps hand-off deterministic — no zombie session graveyard. |
| `remote.SSH.tmux.historyLimit` | `50000` | Maximum scrollback lines retained per tmux terminal. |
| `remote.SSH.tmux.setDefaultProfile` | `true` | Make "Persistent Shell" the default profile so a plain **New Terminal** is persistent. This writes `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.<platform>` at Workspace scope — into `.vscode/settings.json` **inside your remote folder**, which is a tracked file in your repo and is shared with anyone else who opens it. Set to `false` to leave your settings alone and pick the profile from the terminal dropdown instead. |

All other settings (`remote.SSH.*` for SSH config, server install, agent
forwarding, etc.) are unchanged from upstream open-remote-ssh.

## Pasting screenshots into a remote terminal

Press **Ctrl+Alt+V** (**Cmd+Alt+V** on macOS) with a terminal focused to paste a
screenshot from your **local** clipboard into the **remote** terminal.

The problem it solves: your clipboard lives on your laptop, but the tool that
needs the image — Claude Code, say, being asked to fix a visual bug in a webapp —
runs on the server. Nothing bridges the two. So the image is written to the
remote and its **path** is pasted, which is all a CLI tool needs.

- Images land in `/tmp/open-remote-ssh-tmux-<uid>/images/`, created `0700`
  *before* the first byte is written. Screenshots routinely contain tokens and
  session cookies, and `/tmp` is world-readable — the uid in the path keeps other
  accounts on the box out.
- Transfer goes over the **already-open** remote connection
  (`vscode.workspace.fs`) — no `scp`, no second channel, no daemon.
- The path is sent as a **bracketed paste** (`ESC[200~ … ESC[201~`), so a TUI
  receives it as pasted text rather than keystrokes. Without this, Claude Code
  can trigger completion or submit early on the incoming path.
- Progress appears in the status bar only if the upload takes longer than
  ~300 ms, so the common case stays silent.
- Images older than **48 hours** are swept on each connect, scoped to that one
  directory (`-maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.png'`).
- If there is no image on the clipboard, the keybinding falls through to an
  ordinary text paste — it never swallows a normal paste.

**No local setup is required.** Readers are tried in order, fastest first:

| Local OS | Tried first (silent) | Fallback |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| Windows | PowerShell (built in) | editor panel |
| macOS | `pngpaste` (`brew install pngpaste`) | editor panel |
| Linux | `wl-paste` (Wayland), then `xclip` (X11) | editor panel |

If no native reader is installed — or the platform has none — the extension
opens a small panel that reads the clipboard through the editor itself. That
panel runs **locally** even though the workspace is remote, so it sees your real
clipboard; it closes as soon as it has the image and hands focus back to the
terminal. If the editor blocks reading the clipboard without a keypress, the
panel asks you to press Ctrl+V once.

The panel only ever appears when the clipboard holds **no text**, so pasting an
ordinary command never opens anything.

If the image can't be delivered you get an error — the feature does not fail
silently. `Open Remote SSH (tmux)` in the Output panel logs which readers ran.

## Honesty: what this does and doesn't fix

tmux moves terminal lifetime off the client — it does **not** make the network
connection itself seamless. A dropped connection still needs a reconnect (fast,
but not invisible); that's the piece a transport like mosh would solve, and it
was deliberately left out — see
[`docs/idea/decision-mosh-vs-tmux.md`](docs/idea/decision-mosh-vs-tmux.md).
The full breakdown of what survives today vs. what tmux fixes is in
[`docs/idea/persistence-model.md`](docs/idea/persistence-model.md).

### Known limitations in v1.0.0

v1.0.0 was validated against a real rig — two isolated VSCodium clients driving
two Docker remotes over real SSH, with every remote-side assertion read back
over an independent connection. 19 of 21 acceptance rows pass, including every
row covering the two hard invariants (invisible UX, no zombies) and the full
multi-client hand-off model. Full results:
[`results-2026-07-24.md`](docs/plans/2026/07/24/101-v1-tmux-release/results-2026-07-24.md).

Two rows are **not** fully closed, and are listed here rather than glossed over:

- **Windows remotes are untested end-to-end.** The platform gate is confirmed
  to engage (a Windows remote takes the PowerShell install path and skips the
  tmux probe entirely, so it should behave exactly like upstream
  open-remote-ssh), but no real Windows SSH target was available to observe a
  full connect + terminal parity.
- **Long-lived TUI redraw after reattach was not visually confirmed.** That a
  backgrounded process and its scrollback survive a full close/reopen *is*
  verified, as is session adoption across machines — but the specific "a
  redrawing full-screen TUI repaints correctly on reattach" observation is
  still outstanding.

Reports on either are welcome in
[Issues](https://github.com/developerz-ai/open-remote-ssh-tmux/issues).

### Fixed in v1.1.0

Everything below was found in real-world use after the v1.0.0 acceptance run,
and all of it ships in **v1.1.0** — most of it the same shape: a plausible
assumption the code held that reality did not.

The `1.0.x` numbers in brackets are *development* builds, never published — they
record when each bug was introduced or fixed during the iteration between v1.0.0
and v1.1.0. v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 are the only releases.

- **The tmux layer never wired at all** (v1.0.0). A fallback provider and the
  real provider both registered on the `tmux` profile id; VS Code permits one
  per id and *throws* on the second. The throw was swallowed, so every terminal
  silently fell back to a plain shell and no tmux session was ever created.
  Registration now has a single owner (`src/tmux/profileRegistration.ts`).
- **Reopening a window abandoned your work** (through v1.0.2). VS Code keeps a
  closed window's pty alive for its reconnection grace (3h by default), so the
  tmux client stays *attached*. Reconciliation read that as "another machine
  holds this" and handed out a fresh empty terminal instead. Ownership is now
  decided by the client-local mapping, and our own stale client is evicted with
  tmux `-D` (`src/tmux/slotState.ts`).
- **The scroll wheel cycled shell history** (through v1.0.2). `mouse` was never
  set, so tmux left mouse reporting off and the wheel became arrow keys. The
  50k-line scrollback existed but was reachable only via tmux's own
  keybindings — a leaked tmux UI. Now `mouse on`, with `set-clipboard on` so
  drag-select still reaches the local clipboard over OSC52.
- **Terminal options were silently ignored** (pre-1.0.0). `set-option -t <name>`
  needs a trailing colon; without it `status`/`history-limit` never applied.
- **`historyLimit` was a complete no-op** (through v1.0.3). tmux reads
  `history-limit` when a *pane* is created, and `new-session` creates the pane
  before any chained `set-option` runs — so every terminal sat on tmux's
  2000-line default while `show-options` reported 50000. Confirmed on six live
  sessions. The global option is now set before `new-session` and restored with
  `-gu` immediately after, leaving the user's tmux server unchanged.
- **A window reload could disable restore** (through v1.0.3).
  `onDidCloseTerminal` fires for four different reasons
  (`TerminalExitReason`: Shutdown, Process, User, Unknown) and all of them were
  treated as an explicit user close, writing a tombstone. Tombstoned slots are
  skipped by both restore and adoption, so a reload could silently stop
  terminals coming back. Only a real user close counts now.
- **Closing a terminal left an unreachable session behind** (through v1.0.5).
  A user-closed terminal was "tombstoned": the slot was skipped by both restore
  and adoption *while its tmux session kept running on the remote*. It survived
  every reload, nothing would ever show it again, and `tmux ls` was the only
  place it existed — the exact zombie this fork promises not to create.
  Closing a terminal now kills its session, as it does in stock
  open-remote-ssh; only a window close or reload detaches. Sessions stranded by
  an older version are adopted back on the next connect.
- **"Wants to relaunch the terminal to contribute to its environment"**
  (through v1.0.5). The resolver rewrote `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on *every* resolve,
  and any change to an extension's environment contribution marks already-open
  terminals stale. Upstream never sees this — its terminals don't survive a
  reconnect — but here the warning landed on live tmux terminals, where
  relaunching is precisely the action that throws the session away. The write
  is now diffed and skipped when nothing changed
  (`src/common/envCollection.ts`).
- **Pasting a screenshot did nothing on Windows** (v1.0.5). The reader was
  `Get-Clipboard -Format Image`, which exists only in Windows PowerShell 5.x and
  returns `$null` for the DIB that Win+Shift+S puts on the clipboard. It also
  ran without loading its assembly or requesting an STA apartment, both of which
  the clipboard API needs. Windows now uses
  `[System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard]::GetImage()` with both stated explicitly.
  The Linux reader was broken too (`xclip` was passed an `-out` flag it does not
  have, and Wayland had no reader at all), and every failure was silent.
- **macOS remotes never got the default profile** (through v1.0.3). VS Code
  derives `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.<suffix>` from the *remote* OS,
  and the suffix was hardcoded to `linux` — so on a Mac remote the layer wired
  correctly but "New Terminal" still opened a plain shell.
- **One failed terminal aborted the whole reconcile** (through v1.0.3).
  `createTerminal` is documented to throw; a throw skipped every remaining
  session *and* the `persist()` after the loop, discarding mapping state for
  sessions still alive on the remote.

- **Split layouts were thrown away on every reload** (through v1.0.6).
  Terminals were created with `isTransient: true`, which opts them out of VS
  Code's terminal persistence — on the reasoning that tmux owns lifetime, so VS
  Code should keep its hands off. It owns the *session*, but that same
  persistence layer is what restores split and group layout, so every split came
  back as a flat row of tabs. Terminals are no longer transient: VS Code revives
  them and restores the layout with them.
- **Reviving a window created empty duplicate sessions** (v1.0.8 only). The
  first attempt at the above assumed VS Code replays a revived terminal's stored
  `shellArgs`. It does not — it calls the profile provider again, with no
  indication that this is a revive rather than a user pressing "New Terminal".
  Answering that with a freshly allocated slot minted a brand-new tmux session
  per revived terminal: two restored tabs plus two empty ones, every restart.
  Restore no longer creates terminals up front; it queues the sessions that want
  one and lets VS Code's revive claim them, so the layout comes from VS Code and
  the sessions from here.
- **A reload still produced duplicate terminals** (through v1.0.9). The queue
  above was closed on a fixed 2.5 s timer, and the two things it was ordering are
  unrelated: the queue is final when our remote probes finish, while VS Code
  revives when the *workbench* finishes restoring — seconds later on a real
  remote, bounded by nothing observable. Field log: the drain opened both
  survivors as plain tabs at +2.5 s, then the revive arrived at +4.8 s, found an
  empty queue and minted two brand-new sessions with the restored split layout
  wrapped around them. Four tabs, two unsplit and two split. Nothing was
  orphaned — every tab held a live session — but a duplicate is a duplicate, and
  raising the timer would only move the goalposts. The wait now ends on
  *evidence*: every queued slot either claimed through the profile provider or
  observed in the window (a reload inside the reconnection grace reconnects the
  pty without asking for a profile). The timer survives only as a backstop for a
  revive that genuinely never comes — see `REVIVE_DEADLINE_MS`.
- **Races that could cost a session** (through v1.0.8). Three, all reachable:
  concurrent profile requests (exactly what a multi-terminal revive issues) could
  both take the same slot, because the claim was recorded *after* an `await`;
  reopening a just-closed terminal could let `new-session -A` race the
  still-in-flight `kill-session` and lose the new session; and overlapping
  `workspaceState` writes could leave the older snapshot on disk. The mapping is
  the only record of which session belongs to which slot, so losing it strands
  live work.
- **A network blip could wipe the slot mapping** (through v1.0.8). The
  `has-session` probe reported "gone" when the command could not be *delivered*,
  so a dropped channel pruned every mapping one slot at a time — the exact
  failure the `list-sessions` guard was written to survive. An undeliverable
  probe is now "unknown": the mapping is kept and nothing is opened onto a
  session that could not be confirmed.

### Still open

- **A sleeping machine's terminals are not adopted for up to 3 hours.**
  Hand-off works when the other machine's window is *closed*: its sessions go
  detached and the next machine adopts them. Closing a laptop **lid** is
  different — the window never closed, so the remote pty (and the tmux client
  inside it) survives for `VSCODE_RECONNECTION_GRACE_TIME`, 3 h by default, and
  those sessions still read as attached. They are deliberately left alone until
  that expires: adopting them would mean stealing from a machine that may be
  seconds from waking up, and re-attaching a session someone else holds mirrors
  keystrokes into their terminal. Closing the window (rather than the lid) hands
  off immediately.
- **Split layout is restored, but which session lands in which pane is not
  guaranteed.** VS Code restores the arrangement and asks for sessions in its own
  order; they are handed out lowest-slot-first. With several terminals in a
  split, a session can come back in a different pane than it left.
- **Two windows on the same workspace, on the same machine, will fight over
  slots.** The slot mapping lives in `workspaceState`, which both windows share,
  so the second reads the first's live terminals as its own stale ones and
  reclaims them with tmux `-D`. Use one window per workspace per machine.

## SSH Host Requirements

You can connect to a running SSH server on the following platforms.

**Supported**:

- x86_64 Debian 8+, Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS / RHEL 7+ Linux
- ARMv7l (AArch32) Raspbian Stretch/9+ (32-bit)
- ARMv8l (AArch64) Ubuntu 18.04+ (64-bit)
- IBM Z (s390x) Debian 13, RHEL 8+, Ubuntu 22.04+, SLES 15+
- macOS 10.14+ (Mojave)
- Windows 10+
- FreeBSD 13+ (Requires custom serverDownloadUrlTemplate setting)
- DragonFlyBSD (Requires manual remote-extension-host installation)

## Activation

**Configuration**

Your SSH server's configuration needs to have the following setting:
- `AllowTcpForwarding yes`

**Activation**

> NOTE: Not needed in VSCodium since version 1.75

Enable the extension in your `argv.json`

```json
{
    ...
    "enable-proposed-api": [
        ...,
        "developerz-ai.open-remote-ssh-tmux",
    ]
    ...
}
```
which you can open by running the `Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments` command.

The file lives at:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.vscode-oss/argv.json` |
| macOS | `~/.vscode-oss/argv.json` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode-oss\argv.json` (e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\.vscode-oss\argv.json`) |

The publisher id must match exactly — `developerz-ai.open-remote-ssh-tmux`.
A typo here fails silently: the extension installs and appears enabled, but
proposed APIs stay unavailable and remote resolution never starts.
Restart the editor (not just reload) after editing `argv.json`.

**Alpine linux**

When running on alpine linux, the packages `libstdc++` and `bash` are necessary and can be installed via
running
```bash
sudo apk add bash libstdc++
```

## Troubleshooting

All diagnostics live in one place: `Remote-SSH: Show Log` (Command Palette), or
the `Remote - SSH` output channel. The tmux layer logs a line per slot on every
connect, carrying the observed state *and* the resulting action, e.g.

```
tmux reconcile: 2 slot(s) to resolve, 2 session(s) on remote
tmux slot 0: mapped=yes tombstoned=no open=no attached=yes windows=1 -> restore-takeover (ours but held by a stale client — reclaiming with -D)
tmux slot 1: mapped=no  tombstoned=no open=no attached=yes windows=1 -> skip (attached by another client — no steal)
tmux terminals: 0 re-attached, 1 reclaimed, 0 adopted, 0 pruned
```

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Terminals are plain shells; no tmux sessions on the remote | The layer never wired. Log shows `Tmux wiring failed: …` or nothing tmux-related. | Confirm `argv.json` (above), then fully close and reopen the remote window. |
| "Persistent Shell" is in the picker but opens a normal shell | The default profile points elsewhere, so `New Terminal` bypasses tmux. | Set `"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "Persistent Shell"`, or clear your existing default so the extension can set it. |
| Reopening a window gives an **empty** terminal while previous work seems lost | Fixed in 1.1.0. VS Code keeps a closed window's pty alive for its reconnection grace (3h), so the tmux client stays *attached* and v1.0.0 refused to reattach. | Upgrade. Your work was never lost — `tmux ls` on the remote still shows the session; 1.1.0 reclaims it automatically. |
| Scroll wheel cycles shell history instead of scrolling | Fixed in 1.1.0 (`mouse on` was never set). | Upgrade. |
| Splits are not restored after a restart | Fixed in 1.1.0. v1.0.0 marked terminals `isTransient`, which opted them out of VS Code's layout persistence. | Upgrade. |

### Inspecting the remote directly

The extension never hides state from you — everything is plain tmux:

```bash
tmux ls                                                   # sessions (code-<hash>-<slot>)
tmux list-clients -F "#{client_tty} -> #{client_session}" # who is attached
tmux list-panes -a -F "#{session_name} #{pane_current_command}"
```

Session names are `code-<sha1_12(host + " " + workspacePath)>-<slot>`, so each
project on each host gets its own namespace and one session per terminal tab.
Closing the *window* (or reloading) detaches and the session stays alive — that
is the hand-off. Closing a *terminal tab* kills its session, exactly as in stock
open-remote-ssh. Empty leftovers are collected by the reaper on the next connect.

## SSH configuration file

[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) supports using a [configuration file](https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/) to store all your different SSH connections.
To use an SSH config file, run the `Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File...` command.

## Note for VSCode-OSS users

If you are using VSCode-OSS instead of VSCodium, you need some extra steps to make it work.

Modify the following entries in the plugin settings:

```
"remote.SSH.serverBinaryName": "codium-server",
"remote.SSH.serverDownloadUrlTemplate": "https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/download/${version}${release}/vscodium-reh-${os}-${arch}-${version}${release}.tar.gz",
"remote.SSH.serverVersion": "latest",
"remote.SSH.serverValidation": "force",
```

VSCodium versions have an extra `release` part that do not have equivalent for VSCode-OSS.
So leaving `serverVersion` to the default `"match"` will fail.
The plugin will install the latest release of VSCodium if `serverVersion` is set to `"latest"`.
If you need to match the VSCode-OSS version, set `serverVersion` to `"closest"`, to
automatically fetch the last release of VSCodium for this version.

You can look for the release numbers associated with your VSCode version in the
[release page](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/). For instance, for VSCode
version "1.96.0", the (last) VSCodium release number is "24352".

You can also set `serverVersion` to a specic version (e.g. "1.116.0") or a specific
version-release (e.g. "1.116.02821").

If the local and remote VSCodium versions don't match, which will be the case on VSCode-OSS,
remote server validation needs to be bypassed. Setting `serverValidation` to `"force"` will
modify the commit of the remote server to make it match the local VSCode commit.
If `serverValidation` is set to `"skip"`, the remote server will skip checking that the commits
match. This option is working only if the remote VSCodium version is `>=1.120`.

Starting with VSCodium version 1.99.0, the `release` number is not separated from the `version` by a dot `.` anymore.
Therefore `serverDownloadUrlTemplate` needs to be filled with the new scheme (as shown above).

Before 1.99.0, the old scheme needs to be used:

```
"remote.SSH.serverDownloadUrlTemplate": "https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/download/${version}.${release}/vscodium-reh-${os}-${arch}-${version}.${release}.tar.gz",
```

## Credit

This extension is a fork of
[jeanp413/open-remote-ssh](https://github.com/jeanp413/open-remote-ssh), which
does all the heavy lifting of resolving the `ssh-remote` authority, installing
the VS Code server, and running the remote session over SSH. This fork keeps
that entirely intact and adds tmux-backed persistent terminals on top. All
credit for the SSH/server-install foundation goes to the upstream project and
its contributors.
